## Work not Scroll
I have started this project to help myself struggle with procrastination and useless scrolling in the Internet by visualizing the amount of wasted time.
This is a simple stopwatch you can run when you want to waste time instead of working.
I am thinking of developing the project in the future adding saving options and some filters to track the progress.
