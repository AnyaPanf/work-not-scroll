## Work not Scroll
I have started this project to help myself struggle with procrastination and useless scrolling in the Internet by visualizing the amount of wasted time.
So far this is a simple stopwatch you can run when you want to waste time instead of working.
I am thinking of developing the project in the future adding some filters to track the progress.

#Technologies
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Vite
- React
- ReactHooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, custom Hook)
- localStorage
- CSS, HTML

#Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

#npx run dev
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:1573 to view it in your browser.
